# CLAUDE.md — ubx-sdk-typescript

## What this is

The describe-only TypeScript runtime for Ubiquex SDK programs — canonical
source: JSR's `@ubx/sdk`, and `ubiquex`'s own `go:embed` build input.
Coordinating repo: `github.com/ubiquex/ubiquex` (a change here can affect
`ubx` itself, not just downstream `ubx-sdk-<provider>` consumers).

## Session protocol

1. Read `STATE.md` first — current state only, rewritten not appended.
2. `STATE.md` is rewritten, not appended, as the LAST act of every session.
   Anything that becomes history moves to `HISTORY.md`.
3. Only reference Linear issue IDs given in the handoff prompt; never infer
   one.

## Git rules (strict)

- PR-only. Never self-merge — push a branch, open a PR, wait for the founder.
- NO AI attribution anywhere in commits or PR bodies.

## Publishing discipline

- This is a shared runtime, not a per-provider repo — a bug here can affect
  every `ubx-sdk-<provider>` repo's own TypeScript bindings AND `ubx` itself
  (`go:embed` build input). Verify the real, separate published package
  directly (`jsr.io/@ubx/sdk`) before claiming a fix is live — a commit to
  this repo's own `main` is NOT the same as "published". Never infer
  "published" from a commit to the monorepo's own copy alone (`ubiquex`'s
  own CLAUDE.md rule 8). This exact class of mistake already happened once,
  to this repo's own real Go sibling (`ubx-sdk-go`, UBI-131): a Go fix was
  reported "committed and pushed" across multiple session summaries, but
  only the monorepo's own copy had changed — the separate, real repo was
  never touched, still showing its original scaffold commit a full day
  later, caught only when the founder pushed back and a real `git log` was
  run against the actual separate repo, not the monorepo.
